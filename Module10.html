<p>I think I did a good job of separating my HTML documents from my main presentations.</p>
<p>My HTML consists of hrefs, divs, and classes which are pretty bare bones.</p>
<p>My presentations come within my CSS. I think I took the hard road for much of my CSS.</p>
<p>I overcomplicated many simple functions I'm sure, but I would often create 3 to 4 divs</p>
<p>to create just one affect simply to get all the spacing and coloring as I wanted it.</p>
<p>To keep my markup clean in the future I'll be better researched to simply understand what</p>
<p>I'm doing. I think a lot of what I did wrong simply came from misinformation or lack of</p>
<p>knowledge about how to do things better.</p>
