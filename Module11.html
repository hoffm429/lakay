<p>I thought working in scrum teams was one of the best activities in the entire class and should have started earlier in the semester</p>
<p>My scrum team was a place to share what we were going through and find motivation for what to do next.</p>
<p>I truly believe we would all be more successful students if we would have met with our scrum team every single week.</p>
<p>As a first time coder, I struggled a lot, and every time our team met I recieved feedback and assistance.<p>
<p>I also truly do not think this class can progress without those things.</p>
